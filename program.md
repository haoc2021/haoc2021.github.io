          Unprecedented advances in networking technology have introduced network configurability and programmability. However, this increase in network "softwarization" is a double-edged sword. On one hand, network softwarization facilitates the building of line-rate application-specific packet-processing logic. On the other hand, increased network softwarization (perhaps unsurprisingly) increases the frequency and complexity of network faults.

        <p>
          In this talk, I will discuss a peculiar type of a network fault that my group identified: partial network partitioning. First, I will present a comprehensive study of system failures caused by this type of fault. Our study reveals that the studied failures are catastrophic (e.g., lead to data loss) and are easily manifested. Second, I will present an analysis of fault-tolerance techniques for eight popular systems and highlight their shortcomings. Finally, I will present Nifty, a transparent communication layer that masks partial network partitions. Nifty overcomes the shortcomings of current fault-tolerance approaches and effectively masks partial partitions while imposing negligible overhead.

            Samer Al-Kiswany is an assistant professor at the David Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, Canada. His research interests are in distributed systems, networking, and data management and processing engines. In particular, his work focuses on reconsidering systems design in light of recent changes in cloud applications and platforms. Samer received his PhD from the University of British Columbia in 2013. After earning his PhD, he joined the University of Wisconsin–Madison as a postdoctoral fellow. Dr. Al-Kiswany is the recipient of ten national and international awards, including the Killam Doctoral Fellowship and the NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowship.

        Sampling Distributed Traces: Evolution from 2005 to Today

        <p> Distributed tracing has become a widespread tool for understanding the performance of large-scale systems: unlike metrics or logs, traces follow a request through every service to provide critical context for debugging problems. Retaining traces for every request through a system is typically prohibitively expensive, so all systems for distributed tracing sample a subset of traces to save. In this talk, I’ll talk about three iterations of sampling for distributed tracing, starting from the simple, random approach employed by Google’s production tracing system, Dapper, in 2005, and ending in a new approach that Lightstep is beginning to use in production. Over time, technology improvements have allowed sampling decisions to be delayed later and later in the data ingestion pipeline, which has enabled more sophisticated sampling algorithms that consider more dimensions in choosing which traces to save. I’ll end by talking about ongoing challenges and opportunities in selecting the most useful sample of tracing data.

            Kay Ousterhout is a software engineer at Lightstep, where she's building performance management tools that enable users to understand the performance of complex distributed systems. Before Lightstep, Kay received a PhD from UC Berkeley. Her thesis focused on building high-performance data analytics frameworks that allow users to reason about - and optimize for - performance. Kay is also a committer and PMC member for Apache Spark; her work on Spark has focused on improving scheduler performance.
