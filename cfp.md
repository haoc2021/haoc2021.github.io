<h2 class="text-primary">Call For Papers</h2>

The first workshop on High Availability and Observability of Cloud Systems
(HAOC) invites short papers related to the availability and observability of
distributed systems at large scale. The workshop will bring together
researchers and practitioners to discuss and debate emerging techniques, best
practices, early ideas, and the latest progress. We welcome papers that
describe promising innovations, report experiences in the field, offer insights
on problems overlooked by the community (including findings from measurement
studies), and challenge widely-held beliefs, with emphasis on the problems
associated with complex, networked systems that handle high volumes of traffic,
store and serve large amounts of data, or are geographically dispersed. 

Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:
* Monitoring and alerting
* Distributed tracing
* Performance debugging in the large
* Online root cause analysis
* Chaos engineering
* Availability measurement
* Testing and correctness
* Fault tolerance and failure mitigation
* Using machine learning for automation 
* Instrumentation including eBPF techniques and use-cases
* Zero-downtime updates and deployment

<h2 class="text-primary">Submission Guidelines</h2>

The main objective for the workshop is to advance the principles and practices on
this subject by creating a discussion forum that brings together researchers,
engineers, administrators, and practitioners. As such, we do not expect papers
to necessarily include a rigorous evaluation, although we do prefer papers that
provide a crisp problem statement, a compelling motivation for the work, and
some contextualization with respect to related academic work and the current
state-of-the-art in industry.

Papers should be submitted in PDF files. The paper should be **at most 6 pages** in length, 
including figures and tables. Submissions may include as many pages as needed for references.
Submissions should be formatted in 8.5" x 11" paper with a text block 7" x 9", 
using two columns separated by 0.33" (8 mm) of whitespace. Use 10-point type on 
12-point (single-spaced) leading and Times Roman or a similar font for the 
body of the paper. Authors using Microsoft Word or LaTeX should consider using 
the [ACM SIGPLAN template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
A sample is provided in [this repository](https://github.com/haoc2021/template.git):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/haoc2021/template.git
$ cd template
$ make
```

The paper review is double-blind. Authors should anonymize the paper content, 
including removing authors' names and affiliations in the title page. 
However, submissions that describe systems in production or real-world 
experiences need *not* anonymize the paper content other than the 
authors' names, i.e., authors may keep the company's name, production 
system name, etc., as appropriate in the paper, which would provide 
reviewers with better context to evaluate the work.

For any questions, please contact the workshop co-chairs at [haoc21chairs@gmail.com](mailto:haoc21chairs@gmail.com).

<h2 class="text-primary">Publication</h2>

Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital 
Library. The workshop proceedings are in separate volumes from the EuroSys 
conference proceedings, but will be listed as side events of EuroSys '21
in the ACM Digital Library.
